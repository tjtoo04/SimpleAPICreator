# SimpleAPICreator
 A Python app that uses FastAPI and CustomTKinter to create and manage a locally hosted API Server (uvicorn)
 This is an app made to help me learn more about Python and its capabilities.

Required dependencies:
FastAPI library
CustomTKinter library

To run the application, run main.py.

KNOWN ISSUES:
API server does not close fully on SIGTERM, you will have to manually CTRL+C again until I find a solution
